# Gamestop Webscraper for Switch Games

**THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER UPDATED/SUPPORTED AND THEREFORE MOST LIKELY NO LONGER FUNCTIONS PROPERLY SINCE GAMESTOP.COM'S CODING STRUCTURE CHANGES OVERTIME, ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY USE ANTI-SCRAPING TECHNIQUES THAT CHANGE OVER TIME**

## Purpose
Scrapes all the new/used games from Gamestop's website and unloades the information into a .xlsx file. Organizes games by new/used/on sale and color codes accordingly. This project was mainly used by me to watch for sales or find newly released games in the first few months that I bought my Nintendo Switch.

The prices shown for the games in the .xlsx file have a 10% markup to show the price of the game with Reno, NV sales tax.

## Requirements
```
Python3
BeautifulSoup
